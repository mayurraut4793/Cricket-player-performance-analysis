This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of international cricket player performance with a focus on Shubman Gill. Using historical ODI and Test match data, the study applies time series analysis techniques to identify performance trends, check stationarity, and forecast future outcomes.
Key statistical methods such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test are used to examine stationarity, followed by forecasting models including Exponential Smoothing and Holt’s Linear Trend Model. The analysis predicts future runs, batting average, and strike rate, providing data-driven insights useful for sports analysts, researchers, and cricket enthusiasts.
The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels, and demonstrates practical applications of time series forecasting in sports analytics.
